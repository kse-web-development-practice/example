# Pothole APP

## Background

We want to implement an application that allows us to collect and display information about road
quality in the city. It should be available for all users to see issues in two different ways: as a list
and as points on the map. The application should support two user roles: guest and admin. A
user with an admin role should be able to add new and edit existing “issues”. A user with a
guest role should be able only to see existing “issues”. Switching from guest to admin mode
should be possible by authorizing user (using user login and password).

## User stories

### Story 1

As an anonymous user, I want to see all issues in a list view so I can be aware of road condition

### Story 2

As an anonymous user, I want to see all issues in a map view so I can be aware of road
condition

### Story 3

As an anonymous user, I want to find a required issue so I can check if it has been resolved

### Story 4

As an anonymous user, I want to log in so I can add data

### Story 5

As an administrator, I want to add a new issue so I can refer to it so it will be fixed

### Story 6

As an administrator, I want to edit existing issues so I can moderate them and fix possible
spelling errors
